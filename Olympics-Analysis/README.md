## 📌 Project Description

This Power BI project analyzes data from past Olympic Games. The goal was to extract key insights about athlete participation, medal trends, and country performance across different years and seasons. I transformed raw data into a visual story that highlights both high-level trends and hidden patterns.

From the historical dataset, the following insights were derived:

- 🥇 **Russia** has been the leading country in total medals across multiple Olympic Games.
- 🗓️ **1992** marked the most productive year for medal achievements (likely due to the Unified Team).
- 👴 The **oldest participants** competed in the *Art Competitions* category.
- 🔁 There are over **58,000 multimedalists** in Olympic history.
- ☀️ **Summer Olympics** are significantly more active in terms of events and participants.
- 🏃‍♂️ **Athletics** is the most crowded competition category by number of athletes.

## 🧠 Reflections

This was one of my first end-to-end Power BI projects. It helped me better understand not just how to build dashboards, but how to communicate data stories clearly and concisely. The combination of domain (sports), time-series data, and diverse metrics made it both challenging and fun to analyze.
